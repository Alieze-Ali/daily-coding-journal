<h1>November 2025 Files</h1>
<h2>Tuesday Nov 25th</h2>

<p>Ok so what do they say if at first you don't succeed - lol! These past couple of months have been quite trying, but here I am again trying to rebuild my little tower.</p>
<p>Today I did a brief exercise on Strings and learned about indexOf and finding specific characters in strings and using .length. Stuff that's easy but that you can also easily forget.</p>
<p>Honestly, the only reason I was even able to do that is bc I happened to get the day off today. I have the day off every day the rest of this week, so I will commit to doing at least an hour a day or one section a day for the rest of the week and report how it's going. Wish me luck!</p>
