<h1>September 2025 Files</h1>
<h2>Thursday Sept 11th</h2>
<p>Ok - so it's been about 2 weeks since I did anything really. It's been busy, but I'm at least not giving up.</p>
<p>Today, even though I was pretty drained from work. I figured out where I left off and did a small intro to node and js exercise. That's not much, but it's not nothing.</p>

<h2>Saturday Sept 20th</h2>
<p>Looks like it's been a week and a couple days since I've done anything. Man, life be kickin my tail. My job is very difficult to grasp in it's entirety and keep up. Often requiring me time outside of work just to keep up -barely.</p>
<p>And then there's just plain adulting, and trying to keep up with Church and some friends. But I'm grateful Sam & I still meet, regardless of what's going on. It gives me a chance to reset and recommit.</p>
<p>Today I decided to sit down for a couple hours after our check-in to take another stab at the course. It took me 2.5 hours just to do a simple mocha test problem. The test itself was simple - write a comment, write a multi-line comment. It seemed to be asking me to write a console.log as well - but it wasn't. And the test judged passing based on the number of // and /* written - not by just writing a comment or a multi-line comment -so I kept failing over and over and over -even though I was writing what it was asking for - I wasn't writing it according to the requirements of the test specs. I needed to dig into the test specs and understand it was looking for a certain amount of // & /*'s. I needed chat to help me figure that part out. It was incredibly frustrating. But I learned/practiced:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Reading & Understanding a test spec</li>
    <li>Persisting through frustration (I wanted to give up and move on)</li>
    <li>Sometimes, passing one test at a time wont work depending on the spec.</li>

</ol>
<p>I guess overall, it was a good exercise. Proving once again why I need to be coding daily.</p>
