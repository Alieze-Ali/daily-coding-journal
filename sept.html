<h1>September 2025 Files</h1>
<h2>Thursday Sept 11th</h2>
<p>Ok - so it's been about 2 weeks since I did anything really. It's been busy, but I'm at least not giving up.</p>
<p>Today, even though I was pretty drained from work. I figured out where I left off and did a small intro to node and js exercise. That's not much, but it's not nothing.</p>
