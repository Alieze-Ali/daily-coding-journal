    <h2>Entry 1: Wednesday December 11, 2024</h2> 
    <p> Today I added an story to my readme doc. I added an html page. I read and learned about how others can contribute to my repo on copilate. I actually signed up for co-pilate and used it for the first time because Chatgpt was down - lol. Funny I just signed up for a paid sub on Chatgpt and now it's down - lol! Silver lining now I'm using co-pilate. I reviewed some docs about pushing, pulling, branching and merging. I also created an index.html page and an emmet scaffold! More tomorrow!!  </p>
    
    <h2>Entry 2: Thursday December 12, 2024</h2>
    <p>Set up Daily Coding Journal Repo.</p>

    
    <h2>Entry 3: Thursday December 12, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today I figured out how to reboot my live-server vscode extension. It stopped working unless I manually typed the npx live-server in the command line. I tried:

        <ol>
            <li>Making sure I had the latest versions of vscode and live-server by Ritwick Dey</li>
            <li>Disabling all extensions and bringing them in one at a time.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling and reinstalling live-server.</li>
            <li>Making sure live-server was set to google chrome.</li>
            <li>Making sure my computer was set to google chrome.</li>
        </ol>
        Although I did not really want to stop and figure this out as I had a small window to study today - I figured it be a good exercise in trouble shooting. It was rewarding in the end to come to a solution and learn about how extensions work.
    </p>

    <p>I also reviewed some materials on CSS styling. Tomorrow I hope to work a bit on my app and practice CSS as I'm assisting a cohort on CSS.</p>

    <h2>Entry 4: Saturday December 14, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today I got up a bit early to move my job tracker app forward a little bit. I updated the register form and added a form for the login page. Then I met with my collaborator Sam and we did a pull request on github. Hadn't done one of those for a while.</p>
    <h2>Entry 5: Tuesday 12/17/24</h2>
    <p>Played around with html shortcuts in vscode</p>

    <h2>Entry 6: Wednesday 12/18/2024</h2>
    <p>It's challenging for me to make an entry daily - if I do something small I feel like it doesn't count. I go to class Monday-Friday as a module assistant so chances are I am doing some kind of coding even if it's just opening a vscode doc and playing around with something</p>
    <p>Today, I deployed a todo app I started a couple of months ago using netlify. The app is functional - but I did eventually want to add more features. I hadn't deployed anything in a while, so that felt cool!</p>

    <h2>Entry 7: Thursday 12/19/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I learned a little bit about Logic gates as I'm taking a Google IT course - at least I'm working on incorporating this course into my life. I'm also working on incorporating a Data Analysis course. I also experimented with deploying on Netlify. I'm grateful to be working at a bootcamp where I have code in my life consistently. I learned there was a different way to commit and push in vscode not in the terminal - but through source control. I'll have to try that more!</p>

    <h2>Entry 8: Friday 12/20/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I did another practice Netlify deployment from github.</p>

    <h2>Entry 9: Monday 12/23</h2>
    <p>Today I created my first react app using next.js! There were some bugs, fixed them with chat gpt - mostly folder structure problems. It's cool trying something different!! </p>

    <h2>Entry 10: Thursday 12/25</h2>
    <p>I decided to title my entries by entries and not by day. It's hard for me to enter daily - even if I'm working on stuff.</p>
    <p>I've been doing a deep dive into Vercel Docs. I even deployed a site on Vercel - a very cool and robust Platform. It's actually very cool. I did crash my first test app using typescript so I want to udpate that as well. But tomorrow I will add some functionality to my second Vercel app and dive a little further into their docs</p>

    <h2>Entry 11: Friday 12/27/24</h2>
    <p>Today I iterated my Vercel deployment project. I added a navigation component that is displayed on all 9 pages of the app and the links all work! I got all routes working!! Awesome!! I also read a lot of documentation about how Vercel's Edge Network works with Serverless Functions, Edge Functions and Middleware.Feels good to step a bit outside of my comfort zone and learn new things.</p>

    <h2>Entry 12: Saturday 12/28/24</h2>
    <p>Today was a doozie! I updated the format of my vercel app. I thought it would be a quick udpate, but I ended up needing to make another component with a map filter to be able to select the necessary structure for each question. I may need to do the same tomorrow but with more structure for the answers. I hope I can bring this home. I am almost there and almost out of time! But kind of proud of the work I have done so far.</p>

    <h2>Entry 13: Sunday 12/29/24</h2>
    <p>Got my Vercel app up and running. Each page works - I just need to adjust the css on the signature. I think I over css'd. Now I need a break!</p>

    <h2>Entry 14: Wednesday 1/1/2024</h2>
    <p>It's a new year! Well, I just updated the layout of my vercel-app. It took longer than I expected</p>
    <p>Yesterday, I read about APIs a little, but I was too tired for much to sink in. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.</p>

    <h2>Entry 15: Thursday 1/2/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I didn't do a whole lot of coding. I watched a refresher intro video on how Postman works for class. I downloaded/cloned some API and HTTP rest related simple projects to practice on. It was kind of cool running servers and getting into Postman.</p>

    <h2>Entry 16: Friday 1/3/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I just added an image to the Nav bar on my vercel project.</p>
    <p>Then I thought about all that I still need to do and catch up on when it comes to coding!</p>

    <h1>Entry 17: Saturday 1/4/2024</h1>
    <p>Today I met with Sam, we talked about the next iteration in our job tracker app</p>
    <p>I did some updates on my Vercel Project - mostly a comb through to make sure I had all the verbiage in the project. I was surprised - quite a bit of my answers didn't make it into the code. It's all fixed now.</p>
    
    <h2>Entry 18: Monday 1/6/2025</h2>
    <p>Sunday the 5th I reviewed my Vercel project for the last time and turned it in. It's not perfect - but I'd say it's about 80% there on the layout, 95% there on functionality and 85% there on content.</p>
    <p>Today is Monday, I reviewed my Vercel site. In class, I built a server on my local computer and reviewed promises docs. I understand them a little better but could use some hands on practice. I'm proud that I did study today.</p>

    <h2>Entry 19: Wednesday 1/8/2025</h2>
    <p>A lot going on these past couple days and the progression of the fires. I went to class today and yesterday and did a little bit of recap and studying about AJAX, JSON and Vercel - still figuring it out. Downloaded a couple of repo exercises to work on. I did take a JSON quiz over and over until I passed all the questions - I guess that still counts as progress -lol. Until tomorrow! </p>

    <h2>Entry 20: Thursday 1/9/2024</h2>
    <p>Still in the middle of a fire storm - still safe. Went to class today we discussed APIs. API's are a complicated topic. Luckily I found a really cool Tech Blog that explains it: https://read.technically.dev/p/whats-an-api. I also read about the cloud here: https://read.technically.dev/p/whats-cloud. I am remembering that I need to read more articles to expand my knowledge, understanding, vocabulary and curiosity. This blog was suggested by Vercel - so I am excited and nervous about that!</p>
