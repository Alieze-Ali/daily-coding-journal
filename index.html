    <h2>Entry 1: Wednesday December 11, 2024</h2> 
    <p> Today I added an story to my readme doc. I added an html page. I read and learned about how others can contribute to my repo on copilate. I actually signed up for co-pilate and used it for the first time because Chatgpt was down - lol. Funny I just signed up for a paid sub on Chatgpt and now it's down - lol! Silver lining now I'm using co-pilate. I reviewed some docs about pushing, pulling, branching and merging. I also created an index.html page and an emmet scaffold! More tomorrow!!  </p>
    
    <h2>Entry 2: Thursday December 12, 2024</h2>
    <p>Set up Daily Coding Journal Repo.</p>

    
    <h2>Entry 3: Thursday December 12, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today I figured out how to reboot my live-server vscode extension. It stopped working unless I manually typed the npx live-server in the command line. I tried:

        <ol>
            <li>Making sure I had the latest versions of vscode and live-server by Ritwick Dey</li>
            <li>Disabling all extensions and bringing them in one at a time.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling and reinstalling live-server.</li>
            <li>Making sure live-server was set to google chrome.</li>
            <li>Making sure my computer was set to google chrome.</li>
        </ol>
        Although I did not really want to stop and figure this out as I had a small window to study today - I figured it be a good exercise in trouble shooting. It was rewarding in the end to come to a solution and learn about how extensions work.

    <p>I also reviewed some materials on CSS styling. Tomorrow I hope to work a bit on my app and practice CSS as I'm assisting a cohort on CSS.</p>

    <h2>Entry 4: Saturday December 14, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today I got up a bit early to move my job tracker app forward a little bit. I updated the register form and added a form for the login page. Then I met with my collaborator Sam and we did a pull request on github. Hadn't done one of those for a while.</p>
    <h2>Entry 5: Tuesday 12/17/24</h2>
    <p>Played around with html shortcuts in vscode</p>

    <h2>Entry 6: Wednesday 12/18/2024</h2>
    <p>It's challenging for me to make an entry daily - if I do something small I feel like it doesn't count. I go to class Monday-Friday as a module assistant so chances are I am doing some kind of coding even if it's just opening a vscode doc and playing around with something</p>
    <p>Today, I deployed a todo app I started a couple of months ago using netlify. The app is functional - but I did eventually want to add more features. I hadn't deployed anything in a while, so that felt cool!</p>

    <h2>Entry 7: Thursday 12/19/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I learned a little bit about Logic gates as I'm taking a Google IT course - at least I'm working on incorporating this course into my life. I'm also working on incorporating a Data Analysis course. I also experimented with deploying on Netlify. I'm grateful to be working at a bootcamp where I have code in my life consistently. I learned there was a different way to commit and push in vscode not in the terminal - but through source control. I'll have to try that more!</p>

    <h2>Entry 8: Friday 12/20/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I did another practice Netlify deployment from github.</p>

    <h2>Entry 9: Monday 12/23</h2>
    <p>Today I created my first react app using next.js! There were some bugs, fixed them with chat gpt - mostly folder structure problems. It's cool trying something different!! </p>

    <h2>Entry 10: Thursday 12/25</h2>
    <p>I decided to title my entries by entries and not by day. It's hard for me to enter daily - even if I'm working on stuff.</p>
    <p>I've been doing a deep dive into Vercel Docs. I even deployed a site on Vercel - a very cool and robust Platform. It's actually very cool. I did crash my first test app using typescript so I want to udpate that as well. But tomorrow I will add some functionality to my second Vercel app and dive a little further into their docs</p>

    <h2>Entry 11: Friday 12/27/24</h2>
    <p>Today I iterated my Vercel deployment project. I added a navigation component that is displayed on all 9 pages of the app and the links all work! I got all routes working!! Awesome!! I also read a lot of documentation about how Vercel's Edge Network works with Serverless Functions, Edge Functions and Middleware.Feels good to step a bit outside of my comfort zone and learn new things.</p>

    <h2>Entry 12: Saturday 12/28/24</h2>
    <p>Today was a doozie! I updated the format of my vercel app. I thought it would be a quick udpate, but I ended up needing to make another component with a map filter to be able to select the necessary structure for each question. I may need to do the same tomorrow but with more structure for the answers. I hope I can bring this home. I am almost there and almost out of time! But kind of proud of the work I have done so far.</p>
