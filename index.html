    <h2>Entry 1: Wednesday December 11, 2024</h2> 
    <p> Today I added an story to my readme doc. I added an html page. I read and learned about how others can contribute to my repo on copilate. I actually signed up for co-pilate and used it for the first time because Chatgpt was down - lol. Funny I just signed up for a paid sub on Chatgpt and now it's down - lol! Silver lining now I'm using co-pilate. I reviewed some docs about pushing, pulling, branching and merging. I also created an index.html page and an emmet scaffold! More tomorrow!!  </p>
    
    <h2>Entry 2: Thursday December 12, 2024</h2>
    <p>Set up Daily Coding Journal Repo.</p>

    
    <h2>Entry 3: Thursday December 12, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today I figured out how to reboot my live-server vscode extension. It stopped working unless I manually typed the npx live-server in the command line. I tried:

        <ol>
            <li>Making sure I had the latest versions of vscode and live-server by Ritwick Dey</li>
            <li>Disabling all extensions and bringing them in one at a time.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling and reinstalling live-server.</li>
            <li>Making sure live-server was set to google chrome.</li>
            <li>Making sure my computer was set to google chrome.</li>
        </ol>
        Although I did not really want to stop and figure this out as I had a small window to study today - I figured it be a good exercise in trouble shooting. It was rewarding in the end to come to a solution and learn about how extensions work.
    </p>

    <p>I also reviewed some materials on CSS styling. Tomorrow I hope to work a bit on my app and practice CSS as I'm assisting a cohort on CSS.</p>

    <h2>Entry 4: Saturday December 14, 2024</h2>
    <p>Today I got up a bit early to move my job tracker app forward a little bit. I updated the register form and added a form for the login page. Then I met with my collaborator Sam and we did a pull request on github. Hadn't done one of those for a while.</p>
    <h2>Entry 5: Tuesday 12/17/24</h2>
    <p>Played around with html shortcuts in vscode</p>

    <h2>Entry 6: Wednesday 12/18/2024</h2>
    <p>It's challenging for me to make an entry daily - if I do something small I feel like it doesn't count. I go to class Monday-Friday as a module assistant so chances are I am doing some kind of coding even if it's just opening a vscode doc and playing around with something</p>
    <p>Today, I deployed a todo app I started a couple of months ago using netlify. The app is functional - but I did eventually want to add more features. I hadn't deployed anything in a while, so that felt cool!</p>

    <h2>Entry 7: Thursday 12/19/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I learned a little bit about Logic gates as I'm taking a Google IT course - at least I'm working on incorporating this course into my life. I'm also working on incorporating a Data Analysis course. I also experimented with deploying on Netlify. I'm grateful to be working at a bootcamp where I have code in my life consistently. I learned there was a different way to commit and push in vscode not in the terminal - but through source control. I'll have to try that more!</p>

    <h2>Entry 8: Friday 12/20/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I did another practice Netlify deployment from github.</p>

    <h2>Entry 9: Monday 12/23</h2>
    <p>Today I created my first react app using next.js! There were some bugs, fixed them with chat gpt - mostly folder structure problems. It's cool trying something different!! </p>

    <h2>Entry 10: Thursday 12/25</h2>
    <p>I decided to title my entries by entries and not by day. It's hard for me to enter daily - even if I'm working on stuff.</p>
    <p>I've been doing a deep dive into Vercel Docs. I even deployed a site on Vercel - a very cool and robust Platform. It's actually very cool. I did crash my first test app using typescript so I want to udpate that as well. But tomorrow I will add some functionality to my second Vercel app and dive a little further into their docs</p>

    <h2>Entry 11: Friday 12/27/24</h2>
    <p>Today I iterated my Vercel deployment project. I added a navigation component that is displayed on all 9 pages of the app and the links all work! I got all routes working!! Awesome!! I also read a lot of documentation about how Vercel's Edge Network works with Serverless Functions, Edge Functions and Middleware.Feels good to step a bit outside of my comfort zone and learn new things.</p>

    <h2>Entry 12: Saturday 12/28/24</h2>
    <p>Today was a doozie! I updated the format of my vercel app. I thought it would be a quick udpate, but I ended up needing to make another component with a map filter to be able to select the necessary structure for each question. I may need to do the same tomorrow but with more structure for the answers. I hope I can bring this home. I am almost there and almost out of time! But kind of proud of the work I have done so far.</p>

    <h2>Entry 13: Sunday 12/29/24</h2>
    <p>Got my Vercel app up and running. Each page works - I just need to adjust the css on the signature. I think I over css'd. Now I need a break!</p>

    <h2>Entry 14: Wednesday 1/1/2024</h2>
    <p>It's a new year! Well, I just updated the layout of my vercel-app. It took longer than I expected</p>
    <p>Yesterday, I read about APIs a little, but I was too tired for much to sink in. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.</p>

    <h2>Entry 15: Thursday 1/2/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I didn't do a whole lot of coding. I watched a refresher intro video on how Postman works for class. I downloaded/cloned some API and HTTP rest related simple projects to practice on. It was kind of cool running servers and getting into Postman.</p>

    <h2>Entry 16: Friday 1/3/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I just added an image to the Nav bar on my vercel project.</p>
    <p>Then I thought about all that I still need to do and catch up on when it comes to coding!</p>

    <h2>Entry 17: Saturday 1/4/2024</h2>
    <p>Today I met with Sam, we talked about the next iteration in our job tracker app</p>
    <p>I did some updates on my Vercel Project - mostly a comb through to make sure I had all the verbiage in the project. I was surprised - quite a bit of my answers didn't make it into the code. It's all fixed now.</p>
    
    <h2>Entry 18: Monday 1/6/2025</h2>
    <p>Sunday the 5th I reviewed my Vercel project for the last time and turned it in. It's not perfect - but I'd say it's about 80% there on the layout, 95% there on functionality and 85% there on content.</p>
    <p>Today is Monday, I reviewed my Vercel site. In class, I built a server on my local computer and reviewed promises docs. I understand them a little better but could use some hands on practice. I'm proud that I did study today.</p>

    <h2>Entry 19: Wednesday 1/8/2025</h2>
    <p>A lot going on these past couple days and the progression of the fires. I went to class today and yesterday and did a little bit of recap and studying about AJAX, JSON and Vercel - still figuring it out. Downloaded a couple of repo exercises to work on. I did take a JSON quiz over and over until I passed all the questions - I guess that still counts as progress -lol. Until tomorrow! </p>

    <h2>Entry 20: Thursday 1/9/2024</h2>
    <p>Still in the middle of a fire storm - still safe. Went to class today we discussed APIs. API's are a complicated topic. Luckily I found a really cool Tech Blog that explains it: https://read.technically.dev/p/whats-an-api. I also read about the cloud here: https://read.technically.dev/p/whats-cloud. I am remembering that I need to read more articles to expand my knowledge, understanding, vocabulary and curiosity. This blog was suggested by Vercel - so I am excited and nervous about that!</p>

    <h2>Entry 21: Friday 1/10/2024</h2>
    <p>Today, I didn't do a whole lot of code, but I did watch a video on APIs. I went to class, which always helps and Ray shared some cool digital resources for code. I got to watch the students help each other on how to push a zip file up to a repo they created on github. That was pretty cool.</p>

    <h2>Entry 22: Tuesday 1/14/25</h2>
    <p>I've been MIA working on that Vercel project. The conversation didn't go as well as I'd hoped. But I am proud of my work. Round 2 tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Today I did open a couple of repos in class it was about finding and importing files, and exporting them. I didn't finish the exercise as I was trying to sign up for Healthcare - which prices have somehow doubled. So I'm rethinking that. I need to study for Vercel, but that might need to wait until tomorrow.</p>

    <h2>Entry 23: Thursday 1/23/25</h2>
    <p>I've been so busy - almost forgot about my daily coding journal.</p>
    <p>I did a great project for Vercel and studied really hard for the interviews - but I didn't get the job. I asked for feedback, but didn't get any. I will follow up.</p>
    <p>I have a lot of work to do if I'm going to succeed at taking on more hours at App Academy answering questions on intercom. Will start tomorrow!</p>

    <h2>Entry 24: Friday 1/24/25</h2>
    <p>Not much code today. Prepared a document for tomorrow with what I need to review for intercom role.</p>
    <p>I did download an assessment during class, but I didn't work on it.</p>

    <h2>Entry 25: Saturday 1/25/25</h2>
    <p>Got pushed to the edge today, trying to train to help learners. It's alot - not sure I'm up for it.</p>
    <p>I shadowed a support specialist and panicked. I coded all day and panicked. I coded and skipped dinner. I don't think I can do this Thursdays. We only had 2 tickets - but it took like 2 hours - and that's for someone who knows what they are doing.</p>
    <p>Today I worked on some simple API testing using Postman.</p>
    <p>I also downloaded a student repo to try and debug - it took hours. I decided to download Ubuntu WSL as recommended.</p>
    <p>I lived to fight another day.</p>

    <h2>Entry 26: Sunday 1/26/25</h2>
    <p>You ever worked all day on something and feel like you've done almost nothing - lol!</p>
    <p>Today I set up Ubuntu WSL and installed Node.js, NVM & Mocha. Apparently App Academy runs better on Ubuntu.</p>
    <p>I linked my GitHub to VS Code and synced them.</p>
    <p>I did a bunch of configuring - and this is my first entry in my WSL VS Code window.</p>
    <p>I got my first ticket today, although I was terrified - it was a simple one and they only needed encouragement. Hopefully I can put the pedal to the metal this week and ramp up quickly on SQL.</p>
    
    <h2>Entry 27: Monday 1/27/25</h2>
    <p>Today I didn't get as far as I'd hoped, but I did do something.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I started in on SQL course review.</li>
        <li>I started my first Express project on the Ubuntu platform.</li>
        <li>I took a few quizzes on Express.</li>
        <li>I tested a few APIs in Postman - just for funzies.</li>
        <li>I went to class, and helped a student with git. I tried to help another learner with an API Post request.</li>
        <li>I made a journal entry.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm going to bed so hopefully I'll wake up early for Spin tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Entry 28: 1/28/25</h2>
<p>Today I finished my little express server. I successfully:
<ol>
    <li>imported express </li>
    <li> initialized the app </li>
    <li> set it to a port </li>
    <li> set the listener </li>
    <li> set a route with req, res</li>

</ol>
</p>
<p>I accidentally pushed the node_modules folder up with all it's variables - it took forever. I was able to remove them from Github - which took a couple of tries in the command line, but I finally got it working!</p>
<p>I went to class, and helped learners understand middleware by comparing it to bouncers. The instructor and the students who paid attention, really liked the analogy!</p>

<h2>Entry 29: 1/29/25</h2>
<p>Today I set up another express server with one status route in a short projet practice. Wasn't so scary. Chatgpt is always there to answer my questions</p>
<p>I also moved my App-Academy folder out of my default OneDrive. Which I learned has it's pros and cons - but at least now I know. Onedrive - a folder that magically populated but made navigation in the command line a bit of a pain - is a cloud server that backs up my work. Unfortunately this drive doesn't work well with WSL Ubuntu - lol, so I moved my work. I'll just need to remember to back it up. Everything has a trade-off I suppose.</p>
<p>I also read a little bit about Express Route Handlers and took a short quiz.</p>
<p>Despite me being super busy and tired and about to leave, I'm proud I did something.</p>

<h2>Entry 30: 1/30/25</h2>
<p>Today was a little stressful, I didn't sleep much but I did wake up super early for spin, so by the time I finished work I was pretty exhausted. I took a nap, which left me little time to code before class</p>
<p>Despite the knot of anxiety in my stomach, I pushed myself to code for about 30 minutes before class and between class to get something on the books. I amplified my express server with a few more routes and a user.js from a short App Academy tutorial. I also downloaded a few more projects to gear up for SQL.</p>

<h2>Entry 31: 1/31/25</h2>
<p>I didn't have the bandwidth to do much today - but I am proud I did something. I listened to some of the course on express requests. I took a quiz on it. I went to class and ran a small database in the terminal - after installing sqlite & I also installed a GUI for databases.</p>

<h2>Entry 32: 2/2/25</h2>
<p> I need to look up the command to auto enter the time and date. Today I reviewed a lot of material in canvas on SQL and Databases. I took a lot of quizzes. I didn't get as far as I had hoped, but I made progress and really grinded.</p>

<h2>Entry 33: 2/3/25</h2>
<p>Today I spent quite a bit of time reading about SQL tables and databases. I also made a simple SQL database of pies during class. It was cool I got some code in today.</p>

<h2>Entry 34: 2/3/25</h2>
<p>I'm beginning to wonder if I should put my entries in reverse order. Well today I did some reading and quizzes on sql. I ran some sql in the command line. That was cool.</p>

<h2>Entry 35: 2/5/2025</h2>
<p>Today I read about using SQL & Express together. I took some quizzes. I designed a simple visual layout in <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://dbdiagram.io/">, never used that app before.</p>
<p>Almost forgot - I watched a couple tutorials on using git. I'm not excited about the SSH keys - but I'll try it out. I learned what 'git diff' did, and just an overall better view of how simple git commands work and connecting repos both ways - and even creating a file from git. I'll probably watch them again.</p>
<p>I also took a crash course in Salesforce to learn how to set up practice-assessments!</p>

<h2>Entry 36: 2/9/2025</h2>
<p>I can't believe I missed entries for last Thursday & Friday - I definitley did something.</p>
<p>Anyway, today I started a practice assessment for a SQL database project while I managed the intercom queue. I didn't get very far but progress is still a win, even if a small win! I designed a schema and created some tables. Hopefully I can make a bit more progress on that tomorrow.</p>
