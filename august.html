<h1>August Files</h1>
<h2>Friday 1st</h2>
<p>Started Python Course</p>

<h2>Sunday 3rd</h2>
<p>Python fundamentals and experimented with some simple commands.</p>

<h2>Wednesday August 6th 2025</h2>
<p>Today I did some more of that Agile Course my job is requiring and sponsoring.</p>
<p>I also did a short Python Boolean Practice - my mentor talked me into it!</p>

<h2>Thursday August 7, 2025</h2>
<p>Starting over (Since this month). Idk why it's so hard for me to be consistent but trying again. I got some fresh inspiration and motivation so even if I can't get in a full hour, I will try a few minutes of code</p>
<p>Completed Agile Course -earned a certificate/badge!</p>
<p>Practiced a few Python strings exercise.</p>
<p>Reviewed some really cool schemas my students are doing.</p>

<h2>Friday August 8th</h2>
<p>Technically, I didn't do any code. However, I did review a bunch of schemas for students and did stand-ups. I really put in a lot of work today.</p>

<h2>Saturday August 9th</h2>
<p>Technically, again - I didn't do any code. Alternatively - I did have a stand-up with my coding accountability partner, Sam.</p>
<p>We talked about the importance of doing code daily. How I'm committed to learning Python daily. She's going to work on finishing the backend of that job tracker app we started. Then, in 2 weeks she will present it. I'll pick up the frontend. We will both learn Python and then aim to get a Python project done - separately by EOY or sooner.</p>

<h2>Sunday August 10th</h2>
<p>Ok so today I reviewed f-strings. I did an small exercise and followed up with some quick review prints with ChatGPT to make sure I understood it.</p>
<p>I'm kinda disappointed with the fact that I didn't get very far this weekend with code. But not sure how much more I could have pushed myself this weekend.</p>

<h2>Monday August 11th</h2>
<p>So today so far, I completed a little Python strings exercise. It's a small series of questions that took me several short times to complete but at least it's done. I understand a little bit more of Python. Beginning to get a little streak going here. Entry for the last 6 days in a row!</p>

<h2>Tues Aug 12th</h2>
<p>I didn't do that much today - I spent a little time on a simple numbers print exercise during some downtime in class. I didn't finish it yet - but hopefully by tomorrow.</p>

<h2>Sunday Aug 17th</h2>
<p>Busy helping students the best I can. But today I did some simple numbers and booleans exercises. It took me a while - but at least I worked through 2 repos.</p>
