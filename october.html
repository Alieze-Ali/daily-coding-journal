<h2>Friday Oct 24th</h2>
<p>Wow, a month past my b-day. I haven't been on top of this. Today was hard to get back into it - it took me a while to figure out how to get my output to show in the output tab of the terminal - with the help of ai. That was discouraging and kind of encouraging because I persevered.</p>
<p>Otherwise I went over Boolean logic - the simple stuff, which was not super easy for me. I guess at least I sat down for a good chunk and did something.</p>
